## Project Proposals

### 1. e-Commerce Site

**Best Method:** *Iterative/Incremental*

**Justification:** 

- Can build it in small parts

- Can get advice from the client between iterations.

- Good with teams with different experience levels

 **Other considered model(s)**: 
 We thought of waterfall as another option, since they were asking for a shopping catalog which seems pretty straight forward. However these enginners likely do not have shopping expertise so it would be good to do it iterativally with an expertee.


### 2. Dental Office Site

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** 

- Much more flexible

- Better for an evolving product (drastic changes over time)
- Requirements are fully defined at the beginning
- Feedback can be added quickly

### 3. Nuclear Power Plant

**Best Method:** *Spiral*

**Justification:** 

- Better for risk evaluation especially for a nuclear power plant

- Validation and Verification for each iteration

**Other considered model(s)**: 
We thought of using spiral for this project. However when doing spiral you are doing multiple tests after the final product has been tone. But shis would not be a good idea because a nuclear plant has fatal risks especially when you only start testing after it is completed. 

### 4. Department of Transportation

**Best Method:** Waterfall

**Justification:** 
- The requirements are strict and very unlikely to change
- It works with a fixed scope of what your trying to accomplish, timeline and an experienced team
- Very detailed and stable 100 page specification.
- Similar projects

### 5. Reducing Traffic

**Best Method:** Spiral

**Justification:** 
- GPS's are high stake software
  
- People need to commute to vital events in their life and can't afford an issue
  
- Many tests after the final software is complete

### 6. Educational Game

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** 

- Better for an ever evolving product

- Good use case for when requirements are not clearly defined or known from the beginning

**Other considered model(s)**: 
Incremental was also considered, but agile was the better option here as this project is in need of the quickest response time, which agile emphasizes more than incremental.

**Key Aspect(s):** 
Customers wanting to use new games as soon as possible, and the requirements for the games always changing as the customers request new products was the most critical aspect for our decision. This aspect was critical as the agile model is best suited for customer engagement. 

### 7. Global Health

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** 

- Good for small teams like this project that need less overhead

- Better for unclearly defined requirements, and this project seeks to address current global challenges, which may quickly evolve and emerge
  
- Only a few workers so will need cross functional workflow

**Other considered model(s)**: 
Incremental was also considered, but agile was chosen here due to agile's emphasis on less overhead and simplicity, which lends itself well to small team sizes.

**Key Aspect(s):** 
The project being designed to address an issue that can rapidly evolve was the biggest aspect that made us choose agile here. This aspect was critical as different models are better suited for changing requirements, and agile is the best in that regard.
