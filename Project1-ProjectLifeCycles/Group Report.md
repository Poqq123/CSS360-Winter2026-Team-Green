## Project Proposals

### 1. e-Commerce Site

**Best Method:** *Iterative/Incremental*

**Justification:** 

- Can build it in small parts

- Can get advice from the client between iterations.

- Good with teams with different experience levels

### 2. Dental Office Site

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** 

- Much more flexible

- Better for an evolving product (drastic changes over time)

### 3. Nuclear Power Plant

**Best Method:** *Spiral*

**Justification:** 

- Better for risk evaluation especially for a nuclear power plant

- Validation and Verification for each iteration

### 4. Department of Transportation

**Best Method:** 

**Justification:** 

### 5. Reducing Traffic

**Best Method:** Spiral

**Justification:** 
- GPS's also are high stake software
  
- People need to commute to vital events in their life and can't afford an issue
  
- Many tests after the final software is complete

### 6. Educational Game

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** 

- Better for an ever evolving product

- Good use case for when requirements are not clearly defined or known from the beginning

**Other consider model(s)**: 
Incremental was also considered, but agile was the better option here as this project is in need of the quickest response time to changes and most engagement with customers.

**Key Aspect(s):** 
Customers want to use new games as soon as possible, and the requirements for the games are always changing as the customers request new products.

### 7. Global Health

**Best Method:** 

**Justification:**
