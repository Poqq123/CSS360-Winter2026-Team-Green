## #1: New e-Commerce Site
**Model**: Agile
Agile would be the best model for this project since it requires new features to be added over time that might not be clearly defined at the beginning. Since it is an online shopping site, the company would like the site to be functional while the new features are still being developed in order to still have sales, which an agile model allows. Because the same tools and minor modifications are being made, agile is a good fit as it won't bee too complex of a project.

## #2: Dental office site
**Model**: Incremental
Incremental would be the best model since the dentist wants to continually add new capabilities to the site. They have clearly defined and planned features for the future but also want basic functionality first, and incremental allows for usable products at the end of each phase.

## #3: Nuclear power plant
**Model**: Waterfall
Waterfall would be the best model here as a safety and reliability are a priority, and waterfall is a good choice for critical systems. The power plant is also expected to last for a long time, and waterfall is a good model to choose for projects that are expected to work for a long time without many updates.
## #4: Department of Transportation
**Model**: Waterfall
Waterfall would be the best model here as the requirements are laid out and specific. There won't likely be changes to adapt to during the development of this project, and your company has experience with similar solutions so they are unlikely to run into big hurdles and be required to make changes.

## #5: Reducing Traffic
**Model**: Spiral
Spiral would be the best model here as the requirements are well specified in advance and unlikely to change. The system isn't extremely critical so spiral can be used over waterfall as it can potentially mean development could be concluded earlier.

## #6: Educational game
**Model**: Agile
Agile would be the best model here as the requirements for each game will not be clearly defined early on and will be evolving, which agile is good for. The customers also expect the products to be useable as soon as possible, and agile allows for ongoing product development. 

## #7: Global Health
**Model**: Agile
Agile would be the best model here as global challenges may change and emerge and you may want to address these with evolving software. You also have a small number of developers, and agile allows for less overhead.
