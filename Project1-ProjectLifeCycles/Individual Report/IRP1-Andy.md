## Project Proposals

1. ### New e-Commerce site
    * **Model: Incremental** \
    This is a long-term project that requires feature updates on an ongoing basis. Senior developers can do the most important work in the first phase and junior or new hires can build on it later on. Developers can launch an early release with core shopping features and add complex features like create customizable design later on. Therefore, **incremental** would be the best fit for this proposal.
    
2. ### Dental office site
    * **Model: Agile** \
    Initial requirements are simple, but they will continually add more and more capabilities to attract more patients to their clinic. **Agile** methods are great for internet-based product where deployment is relatively easy, such as dental website.

3. ### Nuclear Power Plant
    * **Model: Spiral** \
    This is a critical system with extremely high risk because failure can cause loss of life and catastrophes. The **spiral** model has risk anlysis, validation, and verification for every iteration, therefore, it is the best fit for critical software that monitor the status of a nuclear power plant.

4. ### Department of Transportation
    * **Model: Waterfall** \
    The requirements are very detailed, stable, and has 100 page specification from the client. A fixed timeline of 18 months is predictable, which favors the **waterfall** model. 

5. ### Reducing Traffic
    * **Model: Spiral** \
    Real time performance and reliability are critical and must be tested early. Spiral model is designed to mitigate risks and increase capabilities as it progress. So **spiral** would be the best fit for this proposal.

6. ### Educational game
    * **Model: Agile XP** \
    Internal and external customers expect to use the games as soon as possible for their own testing effort. Extreme programming can embrace preliminary and evolving set of requirements. So **agile XP** would be the best fit for this proposal.

7. ### Global Health
    * **Model: Agile** \
    The whole company consists of only 5 people, so they need a lightweight and flexiable workflow. The goal of the software is vague, it only states to address current global challenges, but didn't specify which challenge. So **agile** would be the best fit for this proposal.
