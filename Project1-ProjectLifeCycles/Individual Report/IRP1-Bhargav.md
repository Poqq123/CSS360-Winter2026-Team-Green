## SDLC Models

![SDLC Graphic](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lambdatest.com%2Fresources%2Fimages%2Flearning-hub%2Fstages-of-software-development-life-cycle.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=398b7580caeec8fae87f9cd74c3968177a0a49012bf902ef9b3eb4f87093cdf3)

*The following contains information about the Software development life cycle (SDLC).*

### Why use SDLC?

SDLC provides a structured approach to building software. It defines phases such as:

- Planning/Strategy

- Design

- Development/Implementation

- Testing

- Deployment

- Maintenance

Using SDLC helps teams improve coding quality, manage time & resources, and also reduce risks for an overall better final product.

### Every SDLC Model

SDLC follows the same core phases (outlined above), but can be very different in how those phases are executed. Some phases want to be very documentation focused, whilst others can focus more on speed.

*The following table contains all of the discussed SDLC Models.*

| Model           | Flexibility to Change | Delivery Speed | Client Involvement | Risk Management |
|:--------------- |:--------------------- |:-------------- |:------------------ |:--------------- |
| **Incremental** | Medium                | High           | Medium             | Medium          |
| **Waterfall**   | Low                   | Low            | Low                | Low             |
| **Agile**       | High                  | High           | High               | Medium          |
| **Spiral**      | Very High             | Medium         | High               | Very High       |
| **Agile XP**    | Very High             | Very High      | Very High          | Medium          |

### How to Evaluate Best-Fit

To choose the best model for your project, there are several factors that come into play. 

1. How stable are the requirements given by the user?

2. How much risk?

3. How large is the project?

4. How frequently will the project change (user feedback)?

5. And more!

Projects with more sound requirements may be better with the waterfall method, whilst projects with changing requirements may be better with agile models.

## Project Proposals

### 1. e-Commerce Site

**Best Method:** *Incremental*

**Justification:** Incremental allows for the team to build in small pieces. We can start with basic shopping features, then add much more customization later. It's also good for teams with different experience levels.

### 2. Dental Office Site

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** Agile is best because the dentist wants to add features over time, and not all at once. Agile is great for frequent changes as new ideas/problems come up. It has a very flexible schedule.

### 3. Nuclear Power Plant

**Best Method:** *Spiral*

**Justification:** Spiral is best because it focuses on identifying and reducing risks very early on, something that is necessary for something like a nuclear power plant. It is really well suited for applications that need to be safe & secure.

### 4. Department of Transportation

**Best Method:** *Waterfall*

**Justification:** This project has very well detailed requirements from the start, something that is great for this method. The team has also done projects that are similar before too. Changes are unlikely, so waterfall is the best method.

### 5. Reducing Traffic

**Best Method:** *Spiral*

**Justification:** This software relies on a lot of real time data, and networking, which adds a lot of risk. these risks need to be addressed early on. So spiral is the best method.

### 6. Educational Game

**Best Method:** *Agile XP*

**Justification:** The requirements for a game change often, and the fixes need to be released very quickly. Agile XP follows exactly this, whilst also supporting frequent testing, something that is very essential to developing a game.

### 7. Global Health

**Best Method:** *Agile*

**Justification:** The project will start really small, and grow very time, so agile allows it to adapt as they learn, which works well for them. It's also flexible for limited resources.
