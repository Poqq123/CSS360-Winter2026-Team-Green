# Project 1 Shreyas Bhattarai: Project Lifecycles

## Project Proposals

### #1: New e-Commerce site : Iterative

This website is targeted to people looking for clothes and not software. Which means that the developer may not understand the shopping strategies and the trends. Iterative would work very well in this scenerio because we start off with a small one and grow to a complete one with guidance of a shopping expertee.

### #2: Dental office site : Agile

In this Dental office website, they wish to add many features without a deadline. And they have a bit of room for trying things out to attract more customers. This is why agile would be the best method because this is evolutionary and would require flexability. 

### #3: Nuclear Power Plant : V Model

Right off the bat this seems like a very dangerous and risky project. So this will need to be robust and have no risk at all. The model for this would be V model since it practices constant testing which will avoid any casualties or disaster.

### #4: Department of Transportation: Waterfall

This project is very predictable and has a time limit. There isn't much risk to this project because enginners have done similar projects in the past. This means that the waterfall method would be ideal since this is just a matter of doing a checklist.

### #5: Reducing Traffic : Spiral

Making a GPS software is very high stakes as car crashes are one of the leading causes of death in America. When the GPS originally came out, it became the cause of many deaths since it was the introduction of using a digital screen while driving. This means that you must be very cautious and use a risk analysis. And the lifecycle with risk analysis is Spiral.

### #6: Educational game : Agile

Here, we need someone who can be a marketing representative and attends educational conferences. Which means we need cross functional workers. This is also very evolutionary as we don't have a specific game we need to make but we need to come up with ideas on the fly. For this kind of flexability, agile is whats needed. 

### #7: Global Health : Agile

This is a project that has a high uncertainty. This means that we need to be very flexible.  Its also not a lot of employees so this means there may need to be some cross functionality.

| Iterative | When You Believe you expect ideas to come in as you are making it.                                   |
| Agile     | When you need high flexibility in the tasks assigned and cross functional workers                    |
| V Model   | When there is extremely high risk so you must make small tests before every step.                    |
| Waterfall | When you already know all the steps and the project is high predicatibility.                         |
| Spiral    | When there is a high risk of making a project so you must do a risk evaluation for every new feature |
